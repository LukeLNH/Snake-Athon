# Snake-Athon
Team Error404's submission to UBC's Snake-Athon competition

## Making the Executable file
In a python virtual environment with cx_Freeze and pygame installed, run

`python setup.py build`

a build folder will be generated, and inside will contain an executable named script.exe. This is our game :)
